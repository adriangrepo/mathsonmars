# Maths on Mars

This repository contains the source code for Maths on Mars, a Flask web app for helping kids learn basic numeracy. I built this app in 2016 to help my daughter learn maths skills.

I had planned to extend the application to allow 'Mr Fuzzplus' the app mascot to go on space missions and learn maths on the way.

However other work took priority and I don't have time to revisit or support this project.
